# OpenCV-WASM

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/echamudi/opencv-wasm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/echamudi/opencv-wasm)

Precompiled OpenCV 4.3.0 to JavaScript + WebAssembly for node.js environment.

In this WASM-compiled OpenCV, there's no need to have OpenCV installed in the machine or using node-gyp.
The entire OpenCV library is already inside this package (opencv.js and opencv.wasm).

## Examples

|---|---|---|

## Installation
```
npm install opencv-wasm
```

## Usage

Because this module is using (almost) the same code as the official OpenCV.js for the web, you can use the same documentation at the web: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d5/d10/tutorial_js_root.html

There are some minor initialization changes, because this module will be loaded synchronously instead of the OpenCV's default (asynchronously). 

You can check the files inside [examples](https://github.com/echamudi/opencv-wasm/tree/master/examples) folder as reference on how to initialize, loading images, and saving images.

## Error Handling

By default, mistakes in code will produce error code. You can use the following snippet to translate the error code into meaningful statement from OpenCV.

```js
const { cv, cvTranslateError } = require('opencv-wasm');

try {
    // Your OpenCV code
} catch (err) {
    console.log(cvTranslateError(cv, err));
}
```

## Versioning

This npm module uses the following versioning number:
```
<opencv version>-<this module version>
```
For Example
```
4.3.0-1
OpenCV version 4.3.0
OpenCV-WASM Module version 1
```
